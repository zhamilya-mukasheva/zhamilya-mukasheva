Welcome!

I am an LSE Fellow in Public Policy at the London School of Economics and Political Science. My research focuses on comparative politics and policy of higher education, in particular political factors behind introduction of tuition fees and financial assistance, public responsiveness to higher education policies, and impacts of financial aid and student number restrictions on match between higher education offer and market demand. I completed a PhD in Political Science in February 2023 at Royal Holloway, University of London. The project was co-supervised by Dr Ursula Hackett (Royal Holloway) and Dr Sofía Collignon (Royal Holloway). My PhD thesis, “The Politics of Cost-sharing in Higher Education in OECD Countries” has won Best Dissertation Award by the American Political Science Association's Education Politics & Policy section in 2024. 


### Policy work

I have undertaken applied research projects focused on public policy within Kazakhstan. In one of these projects, I examined how policies encouraging universities to engage with industry in their research were implemented in practice. The research specifically looked at how universities were finding industry partners for joint grant applications and the support available to university staff in this process. I developed recommendations on how an enabling environment can be created for more university-industry linkages and knowledge transfer. In another project, I developed recommendations on best practices for encouraging beneficiaries of a programme to engage with the existing feedback mechanism, even in a low-trust environment, and how organisational practices can incorporate feedback into their work. 

### Teaching

I have extensive experience teaching undergraduate and postgraduate courses on public policy, politics, and research methods. In my current role, I am leading on curating applied research projects for students, where they can work with the support of an external organisation on a topic that has been offered by this external organisation in advance.
