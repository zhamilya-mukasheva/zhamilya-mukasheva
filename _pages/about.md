I am an LSE Fellow in Public Policy at the London School of Economics and Political Science. My research focuses on comparative politics and policy of higher education, in particular political factors behind introduction of tuition fees and financial assistance, public responsiveness to higher education policies, and impacts of financial aid and student number restrictions on match between higher education offer and market demand. My PhD thesis, “The Politics of Cost-sharing in Higher Education in OECD Countries” has won Best Dissertation Award by the American Political Science Association's Education Politics & Policy section in 2024. 

**Research **

My doctoral thesis examines political factors behind significant changes to higher education financial aid and tuition fee policy in OECD countries from a comparative perspective. The main explanatory variable in my thesis is electoral punishment and rewards faced by politicians who have initiated reforms in this area. I argue that there is a level of public responsiveness to changes in policy, although it is limited to visible instruments – student aid and tuition fees; and that voters support these policies even if they or their children do not benefit from them directly. This has often resulted in preserving the existing policies in the higher education sector and introduction of less visible instruments that allowed increases in enrolment in higher education without increasing public finance available. The result is policies that often have not achieved greater redistribution of educational opportunities available within the system as a whole. 
As part of my doctoral thesis, I have created a comparative dataset of significant reforms in higher education financial aid and tuition fees and looked empirically at the public responsiveness to cuts in higher education funding. The results of this second part on public responsiveness are available here. 
In my ongoing research, I examine other areas of higher education politics and policy. In one ongoing project, I investigate the evolution and impact of policies that introduced restrictions and caps on student numbers in certain disciplines, as well as how changes in narratives about markets in higher education have affected the introduction of these policies.

Policy work **

I have extensive experience undertaking applied research projects focused on public policy within Kazakhstan, mostly working for private clients. In one of these projects, I examined how policies encouraging universities to engage with industry in their research were implemented in practice. The research specifically looked at how universities were finding industry partners for joint grant applications and the support available to university staff in this process. I developed recommendations on how an enabling environment can be created for more university-industry linkages and knowledge transfer. In another project, I developed recommendations on best practices for encouraging beneficiaries of a programme to engage with the existing feedback mechanism, even in a low-trust environment, and how organisational practices can incorporate feedback into their work. 

**Teaching **

I have extensive experience teaching undergraduate and postgraduate courses on public policy, politics, and research methods. In my current role, I am also leading on curating applied research projects for students, where they can work with the support of an external organisation on a topic that has been offered by this external organisation in advance.
