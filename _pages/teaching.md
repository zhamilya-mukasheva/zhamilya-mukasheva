As an educator, I believe that learning should be a hands-on, engaging experience for students. My approach to teaching is built around the idea of active learning through experimentation and discussions. I strive to create an inclusive and interactive classroom environment where students can explore new ideas, develop critical thinking skills, and work collaboratively with their peers. In my classes, there are often practice-led exercises, debates, and ice breaker activities, sometimes even silly ones, such as Jeopardy-style games for students. 

At LSE, I am primarily responsible for curating applied policy projects for students in the Master of Public Policy course. The idea behind the projects is to provide opportunities for students to work with a high-profile external organisation on a policy project that was pitched by the organisation, thus allowing them to work on a 'live' issue. I'm working on all things related to these projects - from leading on the collaboration with the organisations, to formulating research projects and questions, supervision of project groups, and developing and running support sessions for students on research methods to use or narrowing down their initial topic. In the two years, I have been involved with this programme, I have curated over 50 projects for the students, each with a different supporting organisation and a unique topic. 

I am an [Associate Fellow of the Higher Education Academy (2020)](https://www.advance-he.ac.uk/fellowship/associate-fellowship), and working towards my Postgraduate Certificate in Higher Education (PGCertHE) certification at the moment.
