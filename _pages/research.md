My doctoral thesis examines political factors behind significant changes to higher education financial aid and tuition fee policy in OECD countries from a comparative perspective. The main explanatory variable in my thesis is electoral punishment and rewards faced by politicians who have initiated reforms in this area. I argue that there is a level of public responsiveness to changes in policy, although it is limited to visible instruments – student aid and tuition fees; and that voters support these policies even if they or their children do not benefit from them directly. This has often resulted in preserving the existing policies in the higher education sector and introduction of less visible instruments that allowed increases in enrolment in higher education without increasing public finance available. The result is policies that often have not achieved greater redistribution of educational opportunities available within the system as a whole. 


As part of my doctoral thesis, I have created a comparative dataset of significant reforms in higher education financial aid and tuition fees and looked empirically at the public responsiveness to cuts in higher education funding. The results of this second part on public responsiveness are available here. 


In my ongoing research, I examine other areas of higher education politics and policy. In one ongoing project, I investigate the evolution and impact of policies that introduced restrictions and caps on student numbers in certain disciplines, as well as how changes in narratives about markets in higher education have affected the introduction of these policies.
